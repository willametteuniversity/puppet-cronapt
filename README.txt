Puppet Module for cron-apt
==========================

This is a Puppet module to install and configure cron-apt. You'll
probably want to use it in combination with a module to manage APT
itself. [puppetlabs-apt](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-apt) is
probably a pretty good choice in that respect.
